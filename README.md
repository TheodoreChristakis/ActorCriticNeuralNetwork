# ActorCriticNeuralNetwork
This is a basic actor critic neural network that can perform exceptionally well in defined environments and was extensively tested using the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control) environments. For other defined environments this can be adapted by merely adjusting the running_reward algorithm and completion check. There is an abundance of documentation within the code for users who are new to reinforcement learning.

## Dependencies
- Pytorch
- Gym (For open-ai gym use)
- Numpy
